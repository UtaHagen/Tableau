# Tableau
Study Guide:

it’s all about learning from the community:

1. Reverse engineering dashboards

2. Getting answers from the forums

3. Reading blogs from tableau creators

4. Participating in community projects

5. And practicing regularly (most important!)

Blogs: Flerlage twins, Ryan Sleeper, the Data School, Herdata.net, Tableau’s Datafam Roundups

Community projects: Makeover Monday, Iron Quest, RWFD, Sports Viz Sunday - all have regular content roundups

For books specifically, the Makeover Monday book was great and had plenty of examples.
